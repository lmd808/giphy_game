# giphy_game
This is my gifphy api project 
# format 
a preloaded array has its values pushed into buttons when the document loads 
the user has the option of adding button to the button row by adding them via the search bar on the right hand side 

# gif loading
if you click on the button it will give you a list of 10 gifs for that search term ex. puppy will load 10 gifs of puppies 

gifs all load with their still url 

if you click on a gif it will change their state to animate
if you clikc on it again it will refreeze 

# issues
It's not an issue, but i'm trying to get ahead with work. So should and could I spend more time on this and make it look perfect? Yes. But do I have the time to? not right now. 
I'm not happy about that, but I have to live with it for now.
